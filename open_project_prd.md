# PRD - Open Existing Project Feature
## Claude Code UI Enhancement

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Author:** Product Requirements Document  
**Status:** Draft  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Overview
This PRD outlines the implementation of an "Open Existing Project" feature for Claude Code UI, enabling users to work with existing projects from their file system through the graphical interface. Currently, the Claude Code UI only supports creating new projects, limiting users from leveraging existing codebases.

### 1.2 Business Objectives
- **Increase user adoption** by removing barriers to working with existing projects
- **Improve user experience** by providing complete project management capabilities
- **Enhance productivity** by enabling seamless integration with existing development workflows
- **Maintain parity** between CLI and GUI functionality

### 1.3 Success Metrics
- **User Engagement**: 40% increase in active users within 30 days
- **Feature Adoption**: 60% of users utilize the Open Project feature within first week
- **User Satisfaction**: 85% positive feedback on ease of use
- **Technical Performance**: <2 second project initialization time

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current State
Claude Code UI serves as a graphical interface for the Claude Code CLI, providing:
- Visual project and session management
- Chat-based interaction with Claude
- Cross-platform support (desktop and mobile)
- Project creation capabilities

### 2.2 Pain Points
1. **Limited Project Access**: Users cannot open existing projects from their file system
2. **Workflow Disruption**: Developers must use CLI for existing projects, GUI for new ones
3. **User Frustration**: No way to leverage existing codebases through the preferred interface
4. **Incomplete Feature Set**: GUI lacks parity with CLI capabilities

### 2.3 User Impact
- **Developers** cannot use preferred GUI for existing projects
- **Teams** face inconsistent tooling across project types
- **New Users** have limited entry points to Claude Code ecosystem

---

## 3. Solution Overview

### 3.1 Proposed Solution
Implement an "Open Existing Project" feature that allows users to:
1. Browse and select existing project directories
2. Automatically initialize Claude Code CLI within selected project
3. Seamlessly integrate opened projects into the existing UI workflow
4. Maintain all current functionality while adding new capabilities

### 3.2 Core Components
1. **Directory Selection Interface**
2. **Project Initialization Logic**
3. **UI Integration**
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
5. **Error Handling and Validation**
